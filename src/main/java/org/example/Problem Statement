1. In modern applications, maintaining persistent connections with clients is essential for real-time communication, file transfers, and continuous data streaming.
   Your challenge is to develop a TCP server using Vert.x that can handle multiple client connections simultaneously, ensuring each connection remains persistent while
   efficiently managing data flow between the server and its clients.

   Requirement:
   - Create a robust TCP server that accepts connections from multiple clients, supports persistent connections, and facilitates bidirectional data exchange.
   - Develop a TCP server that can accept multiple simultaneous client connections using Vert.x NetServer. Each connected client should have its connection state managed independently.

2. In today's interconnected world, servers need to handle multiple clients efficiently and scalably.
   Your challenge is to develop an enhanced version of a TCP server that can manage numerous client connections, each with its own processing logic.
   Create a robust TCP server using Vert.x that processes multiple client connections concurrently.
   Each client connection should have its own "processing verticle" to handle communication independently.
   Also, the server should dispatch events to each client at precisely the time specified by the clients.

   Requirements
   Connection Handling:
   Implement a mechanism to manage connections using NetSocket in Vert.x.
   Ensure each connection spawns a dedicated verticle (ChildVerticle) for handling client-specific tasks, such as message processing and response.
